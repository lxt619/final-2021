                    <h2>Chinese Zither üéµ</h2>
                    <p>Chinese Zither, aka GuZheng (Âè§Á≠ù) is a traditional Chinese musical instrument. I started to learn it at the age of four and have completed all the exams by the age of ten. I usually like to play my favorite music, and I think it is a good way to relax my body and mind.</p><br>

                    <h2>Photography üìπ</h2>
                    <p>During my high school years, I started to get into photography. I started my first photography studio in my home, and during the time the studio was running, I had clients coming to me every week to take pictures. Usually it was Chinese and Japanese type photos. I would also take landscapes, if on a trip out. I think taking pictures is a good way to document your mood. Sometimes even though you don't remember an event, you see the photo and remember the story.</p><br>

                    <p>I love watching movies, but since COVID-19 started spreading, I rarely go to the cinema. But it's also fun to watch movies at home. I usually prepare snacks and drinks and invite my friends over. My favorite type of movie to watch is romantic movies, followed by action movies.</p>
