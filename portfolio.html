                    <p>Listand Me is the first project I finished by myself. I used 4 monthes on it, and experienced exploring problems, analysis, interviewing, paper prototyping, testing, final prototyping, etc. It is a social media platform focus on child-parent communication. The problem I try to solve is parent-child communication. It is very difficult for some families. I support the platform for them to understand each others.</p>
